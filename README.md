Customer Churn Analysis using Machine Learning

PROJECT OVERVIEW : 

Customer churn analysis focuses on identifying customers who are likely to discontinue a service. This project applies machine learning classification techniques to predict customer churn based on historical customer data. The objective is to help businesses take data-driven retention decisions by understanding churn patterns and key influencing factors.

OBJECTIVES : 

* Analyze customer behavior using exploratory data analysis (EDA)

* Perform data preprocessing and feature scaling

* Build and compare multiple machine learning classification models

* Evaluate model performance using standard classification metrics

DATASET DESCRIPTION : 

The dataset contains customer-related features such as:

   * Demographic information

   * Service usage details

   * Account-related attributes

   * Churn label (target variable)

TECHNOLOGIES AND LIBRARIES USED :

* Python

* NumPy

* Pandas

* Matplotlib

* Seaborn

* Scikit-learn

METHODOLOGY :

1. Data Preprocessing

* Handled categorical variables using Label Encoding

* Standardized numerical features using StandardScaler

* Split data into training and testing sets

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Visualized feature distributions

* Analyzed relationships between features and churn

* Identified patterns influencing customer churn

3. Model Building

The following machine learning models were trained and evaluated:

* Random Forest Classifier

* Support Vector Machine (SVM)

* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Each model was trained using the same training data to ensure fair comparison.

MODEL EVALUATION :

Models were evaluated using:

* Accuracy Score

* Confusion Matrix

* Classification Report

* ROC-AUC Score

Performance comparison helped identify the most effective model for churn prediction.

RESULTS : 

* The models demonstrated varying performance based on classification metrics

* Ensemble and distance-based models showed competitive results

* The evaluation highlights how model choice impacts churn prediction accuracy
